# 📧 Disable Email Confirmation for Testing

## Why You're Seeing This Error

When you register, Supabase creates the auth user but **requires email confirmation** by default. Until the email is confirmed, the user can't login, causing the "profile not found" error.

## ✅ Quick Fix: Disable Email Confirmation

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard

1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sikuvuepkmuoxvrwvjyo
2. Click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Providers"** tab
4. Scroll down to **"Email"** section

### Step 2: Disable Confirmation

1. Find **"Confirm email"** toggle
2. **Turn it OFF** (disable it)
3. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Test Again

1. Stop your app (Ctrl+C)
2. Delete any test users from Authentication → Users
3. Run `npm start` again
4. Try registering a new account
5. You should be able to login immediately!

## 🎯 What This Does

- ✅ Users can login immediately after registration

## 🔄 Alternative: Confirm Existing Users Manually

If you want to keep email confirmation enabled:

1. Go to Authentication → Users
2. Find your test user
3. Click the **"..."** menu
4. Click **"Confirm user"**
5. Now you can login!

## ✨ What I Fixed in the Code

1. **Better success message**: Now shows "Account created successfully! You can now login"
2. **Error handling**: App handles missing profiles gracefully
3. **Auto sign-out**: If profile not found, user is signed out to prevent stuck state

---

## 🚀 Try This Now:

1. **Disable email confirmation** (steps above)
2. **Delete test users** from Authentication → Users
3. **Restart app**: `npm start`
4. **Register new account**
5. **Login immediately** - should work!

**After this fix, registration → login flow will be smooth! 🎉**
