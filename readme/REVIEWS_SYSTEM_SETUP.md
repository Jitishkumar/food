# Reviews & Reports System - Complete Setup Guide

## 🐛 Errors Fixed

### 1. Type Mismatch Error (FIXED ✅)
**Error:** `"structure of query does not match function result type"`
- **Cause:** Function returned `DOUBLE PRECISION` for latitude/longitude but table has `NUMERIC(10,8)`
- **Fix:** Changed return types to `NUMERIC` in the function

### 2. Foreign Key Relationship Error (FIXED ✅)
**Error:** `"Could not find a relationship between 'food_item_reviews' and 'user_id'"`
- **Cause:** Supabase PostgREST couldn't join with `auth.users` table using incorrect syntax
- **Fix:** Changed query to fetch reviews and profiles separately

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Reviews System:
1. Search for nearby food items
2. Click the ⋮ button on a food card
3. Click "Rate & Review"
4. Submit a rating (1-5 stars) and optional review text
5. See your review appear in the "All Reviews" section
6. Close and reopen - your review should be there
7. Update your review - it should replace the old one

### Verify Database:
```sql
-- Check reviews
SELECT * FROM food_item_reviews;

-- Check if ratings are showing in search
SELECT name, average_rating, total_reviews 
FROM search_food_items_nearby(28.6139, 77.2090, 10, NULL, NULL);
```
