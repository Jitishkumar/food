# Fix Delete Business Issue - Complete Guide

## üêõ Problem
Business cannot be deleted from the app. The delete button doesn't work and businesses remain in the database.

## üîç Root Cause
**Missing RLS DELETE Policy** - The businesses table has RLS enabled but no DELETE policy, so authenticated users cannot delete their own businesses.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution - Run These SQL Scripts

### **Step 1: Add DELETE Policy for Businesses** (REQUIRED)

**File:** `/sql/fix_delete_rls_policy.sql`

Open your **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
-- Add DELETE policy for businesses
CREATE POLICY "Owners can delete own businesses"
ON public.businesses
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);
```

This allows business owners to delete their own businesses.

---

### **Step 2: Fix CASCADE DELETE** (RECOMMENDED)

**File:** `/sql/fix_cascade_delete.sql`

This ensures when a business is deleted, all related data (food items, reviews, reports) are also automatically deleted.

Run the entire file in **Supabase SQL Editor**.

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Adds CASCADE DELETE to food_items ‚Üí businesses relationship
- ‚úÖ Adds CASCADE DELETE to food_item_reviews ‚Üí food_items relationship
- ‚úÖ Adds CASCADE DELETE to food_item_reports ‚Üí food_items relationship
- ‚úÖ Adds DELETE policies for all related tables
- ‚úÖ Verifies all constraints are properly set

---

## üìã Current RLS Policies

### Before Fix:
```
Businesses Table RLS Policies:
‚úÖ SELECT - "Businesses are viewable by everyone"
‚úÖ INSERT - "Owners can create businesses"
‚úÖ UPDATE - "Owners can update own businesses"
‚ùå DELETE - MISSING! (This is the problem)
```

### After Fix:
```
Businesses Table RLS Policies:
‚úÖ SELECT - "Businesses are viewable by everyone"
‚úÖ INSERT - "Owners can create businesses"
‚úÖ UPDATE - "Owners can update own businesses"
‚úÖ DELETE - "Owners can delete own businesses" (NEW!)
```

### After Running the SQL:

1. **Reload your app** (press 'r' in Expo terminal)
2. Go to **OwnerDashboard**
3. Click on any business

- ‚úÖ Success alert shows: "Business deleted successfully"
- ‚úÖ Navigates back to OwnerDashboard
- ‚úÖ Business is removed from the list
- ‚úÖ Business is deleted from database
- ‚úÖ All food items are also deleted (if CASCADE is set up)
- ‚úÖ All reviews are also deleted (if CASCADE is set up)

## üìä Database Relationships

```
businesses (owner_id ‚Üí profiles.id)
    ‚Üì ON DELETE CASCADE
food_items (business_id ‚Üí businesses.id)
    ‚Üì ON DELETE CASCADE
food_item_reviews (food_item_id ‚Üí food_items.id)
food_item_reports (food_item_id ‚Üí food_items.id)
```

**When you delete a business:**
1. Business record is deleted
2. All food_items for that business are deleted (CASCADE)
3. All reviews for those food items are deleted (CASCADE)
4. All reports for those food items are deleted (CASCADE)

## üîê RLS Policies Needed

### businesses table:
```sql
-- SELECT (already exists)
CREATE POLICY "Businesses are viewable by everyone"
ON businesses FOR SELECT TO public
USING (true);

-- INSERT (already exists)
CREATE POLICY "Owners can create businesses"
ON businesses FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = owner_id);

-- UPDATE (already exists)
CREATE POLICY "Owners can update own businesses"
ON businesses FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);

-- DELETE (NEW - needs to be added)
CREATE POLICY "Owners can delete own businesses"
ON businesses FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);
```

### food_items table:
```sql
-- DELETE (recommended)
CREATE POLICY "Owners can delete own food items"
ON food_items FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM businesses 
    WHERE businesses.id = food_items.business_id 
    AND businesses.owner_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

## üö® Common Errors

### Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"
**Cause:** Missing DELETE policy  
**Fix:** Run Step 1 SQL (add DELETE policy)

### Error: "update or delete on table violates foreign key constraint"
**Cause:** Foreign keys don't have CASCADE DELETE  
**Fix:** Run Step 2 SQL (fix CASCADE DELETE)

### Error: "permission denied for table businesses"
**Cause:** User is not authenticated or not the owner  
**Fix:** Ensure user is logged in and owns the business
