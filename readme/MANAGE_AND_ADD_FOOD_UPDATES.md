# ManageBusinessScreen & AddFoodItemScreen Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. ManageBusinessScreen.js ✅

#### Address Fields - Read-Only
**Changes:**
- ✅ Address field is now **read-only** (cannot be edited)
- ✅ City field is now **read-only** (cannot be edited)
- ✅ State field is now **read-only** (cannot be edited)
- ✅ All three fields display with gray background to indicate they're disabled

**UI Display:**
```
Address (Read-only)
[Gray background - cannot edit]

City (Read-only)    |    State (Read-only)
[Gray background]   |    [Gray background]
```

**Why Read-Only?**
- Address, city, and state are set when the business is created
- They come from GPS coordinates (reverse geocoding)
- Cannot be changed to maintain location accuracy

#### Delete Business Button
**Already Exists:**
- ✅ Delete button is already present at the bottom of the screen
- ✅ Shows confirmation dialog before deleting
- ✅ Deletes business and all associated food items
- ✅ Navigates back after successful deletion

**Button Text:**
- Normal: "Delete Business"
- Loading: "Deleting..."

**Confirmation Dialog:**
```
Delete Business
Are you sure you want to delete this business? 
This will remove all associated food items and reviews.

[Cancel]  [Delete]
```

#### City and State Fields - Editable
**Changes:**
- ✅ City and State are now **editable** (can be changed)
- ✅ Each field has its own label
- ✅ Separate placeholders: "Enter city" and "Enter state"
- ✅ Pre-filled with business location data
- ✅ Can be overridden by the user

**UI Display:**
```
Business Address (Read-only)
[Gray background - shows business address]

City *              |    State *
