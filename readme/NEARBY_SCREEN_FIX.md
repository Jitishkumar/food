# NearbyScreen Fix - Food Items Display

## 🐛 Error Fixed
**Error:** "cannot coerce the result to a single json object"

**Cause:** The search function now returns **food items** instead of businesses, but the code was trying to navigate using `item.id` (food item ID) instead of `item.business_id`.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Fix
**Before:**
```javascript
onPress={() => navigation.navigate('BusinessDetail', { businessId: item.id })}
```

**After:**
```javascript
onPress={() => navigation.navigate('BusinessDetail', { businessId: item.business_id })}
```

### 2. Display Updates

**Now Shows Food Item Information:**
- **Food Name** (instead of business name)
- **Category** (instead of business type)
- **Price** (₹XX.XX)
- **Distance** + Business Name
- **City & State** (if available)
- **Rating** with review count

**Before:**
```
Business Name
Business Type
📍 0.5 km away
⭐ 4.5
```

**After:**
```
Cake
Bakery
₹10.00
📍 0.5 km away • Taj Hotel
🗺️ Delhi, Delhi
⭐ 4.5 (12 reviews)
```

### 3. Text Updates
- Changed "Found X places nearby" → "Found X food items nearby"
